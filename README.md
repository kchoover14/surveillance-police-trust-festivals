# surveillance-police-trust-festivals
This repo contains an R Markdown file with code and text that serves as Supplementary Materials for the paper "Surveillance, Trust, and Policing at Music Festivals". 
This repo contains data used for analysis.

The Excel spreadsheet via which data are shared includes three tabs: original survey data, qualitative data from write-in responses, and the data used for analysis. The original survey data were aimed at addressing two issues. The first issue was using the festival as a natural lab for understanding how aware the public are about changes in security 1. The second issue was using the festival as a natural lab for understanding public trust in security (whether police, private security, or surveillance). In addressing the second issue, we modified the original survey results by either collapsing a group of related answers into one column (a positive response in any column per group counted as a positive response for collapsed column), eliminating choices that were not relevant to this paper, treating the response ‘I’m not sure’ as missing data (small n), and numerically coding ordinal variables. Details are as follows.

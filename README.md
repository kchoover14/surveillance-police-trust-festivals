**Data for Surveillance Trust**
Survey data were imported from Survey Monkey and cleaned by JCB. The data in the Excel spreadsheet in this repository are found on three tabs: 
 - original survey data
 - qualitative data from write-in responses
 - and the data used for analysis.

**Modified survey data for Suveillance Trust**
For analytical purposes, original survey questions/answer choices were modified by collapsing multiple responses into one column (a positive response in any column per group counted as a positive response for collapsed column), eliminating choices not relevant to one of the two papers extending from the data, treating the response ‘I’m not sure’ as missing data (small n), and numerically coding ordinal variables. Details follow.
